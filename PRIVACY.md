# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: June 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy governs the use of artificial intelligence features within the SyntX VS Code extension ("Extension") provided by Orangecat Technologies Private Limited ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of our End-User License Agreement and should be read in conjunction with it.

## 2. AI Model Selection and Integration

2.1. **Model Choice**. SyntX is designed as an AI integration platform that allows users to select and connect to various AI models according to their preferences and requirements. These may include but are not limited to:

- Commercial cloud-based models (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic)
- API aggregation services (e.g., OpenRouter)
- Local models via applications such as Ollama or LM Studio
- Self-hosted models deployed on private infrastructure

    2.2. **Model Responsibility**. Each AI model provider maintains its own terms of service, usage policies, and pricing structures. Users are responsible for:

- Complying with the selected AI provider's terms of service
- Managing their own API keys and authentication credentials
- Bearing any costs associated with API usage charged by the model provider
- Ensuring they have proper authorization to use the selected AI model

    2.3. **No Default Model**. The Company does not provide a default AI model with the Extension. Users must configure their preferred AI model to utilize the Extension's AI-powered features.

## 3. AI Features and Capabilities

3.1. **Core Capabilities**. The Extension leverages AI to provide various software development assistance features, including but not limited to:

- Code completion and generation
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Bug detection and resolution suggestions
- Documentation generation
- Natural language to code translation
- Code explanation and analysis

    3.2. **Customization**. The Extension offers extensive customization options, allowing users to:

- Define custom modes for specific development tasks
- Adjust AI behavior through prompting and context settings
- Create specialized workflows tailored to specific programming languages or frameworks
- Configure interaction methods and user interface elements

    3.3. **Feature Limitations**. The Company makes no guarantee regarding the availability, functionality, or performance of any AI feature, as these may be dependent on:

- The capabilities of the user-selected AI model
- API availability and rate limits of third-party providers
- Technical limitations of the Visual Studio Code environment
- Internet connectivity and latency issues

## 4. Data Usage and Privacy

4.1. **Where Your Data Goes (And Where It Doesn't)**

a. **Code & Files**:

- SyntX Code accesses files on your local machine when needed for AI-assisted features.
- When you send commands to SyntX Code, relevant files may be transmitted to your chosen AI model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) to generate responses.
- The Company does not have access to this data, but AI providers may store it per their privacy policies.

b. **Commands**:

- Any commands executed through SyntX Code happen on your local environment.
- When you use AI-powered features, the relevant code and context from your commands may be transmitted to your chosen AI model provider.
- The Company does not have access to or store this data, but AI providers may process it per their privacy policies.

c. **Prompts & AI Requests**:

- When you use AI-powered features, your prompts and relevant project context are sent to your chosen AI model provider to generate responses.
- The Company does not store or process this data.
- AI providers have their own privacy policies and may store data per their terms of service.

d. **API Keys & Credentials**:

- If you enter an API key (e.g., to connect an AI model), it is stored locally on your device.
- API keys are never sent to the Company or any third party, except the provider you have chosen.

e. **Telemetry (Usage Data)**:

- The Company only collects feature usage and error data only when its enabled.
- Telemetry is powered by PostHog and helps understand feature usage to improve SyntX Code.
- This includes your VS Code machine ID, feature usage patterns, and exception reports.
- The Company does NOT collect your code, or AI prompts.

f. **SyntX Provider Usage**:

- When using the SyntX provider service, the Company collects non-anonymous usage statistics.
- This data is specifically used for calculating and tracking credit costs incurred by users.
- This collection is necessary for proper accounting and billing purposes.
- This data is only collected when utilizing the Company's own SyntX provider service.

    4.2. **Zero Data Retention**. The Company adheres to a strict zero data retention policy regarding user code, prompts:

- No user code or prompts are stored on Company servers
- No AI interaction content is preserved after session completion
- No user data is used for AI training or model fine-tuning

    4.3. **Local Processing**. All AI interactions occur directly between the user's local environment and their selected AI provider:

- The Company does not act as an intermediary for AI requests
- The Company does not cache or store AI responses
- The Company does not monitor or review AI interactions

    4.4. **How We Use Your Data (If Collected)**

- If you opt-in to telemetry, it is used solely to understand feature usage and improve SyntX Code.
- The Company does NOT sell or share your data.
- The Company does NOT train any models on your data.

    4.5. **Your Choices & Control**

- You can run models locally to prevent data being sent to third-parties.
- By default, telemetry collection is on and if you turn it off, you can opt in at any time.
- You can delete SyntX Code to stop all data collection.

    4.6. **Third-Party Data Practices**. Users should be aware that third-party AI providers may have different data retention and usage policies:
